        Hello! My name is Daberechi Levi Nwachukwu, I live in Nigeria, West
        Africa and I love technology and all the amazing opportunities it offers
        in making our lives easy and promoting quality of life with the wealth
        of information it provides. I love and enjoy coding and I am excited to
        take this course and advance in my web development skills. My goal is to
        become an accomplished software engineer, building the next generation
        great product that will improve life and bring smiles on the faces of
        those around me.
